#RadPad protocol applied to a simple binary character space for easy processing
#P=1+2 characters in a simple binary character space
#R=any Primitive Root of P
#Lowercase values must never be shared but capital values are safe to share
#x represents the first party, y represents the second
#x=Private, X=Public, sx=Shift. Same applies to y, Y, and sy
